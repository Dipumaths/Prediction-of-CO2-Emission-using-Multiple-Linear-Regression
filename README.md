– Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset with 12 columns and over 7k instances using ggplot2 in R
– Grouped the original categories of categorical predictors into broader categories for enhanced representation
– Implemented log transformation on the response variable and the numerical covariates to normalize the data
– Fitted a Multiple Linear Regression Model after removing multicollinearity from the data by the use of VIF
– Arrived at an R2 score of 94.47% and an Adjusted R2 score of 89.18% on the testing data
